My
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">first computer</a>
learned me to program in [Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) Assembly Language and 4 kB memory.

Over a decade later; Email, UseNet, ListServ, FTP, Archie, Gopher and Veronica had been my professional tools for 4 years before I fell in love with HTML and The Web.

The Web ruled, and became [Behemoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behemoth).

In the past decade I saw the (Front-end) development world change into a for
'rocket-scientists' only profession.  
[Tools](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/tools.html) have become more important
than programming.

And then I learned about native Web Components and fell in love with HTML, and
my job, again.

Developing Web Components requires a different mind-set, it is totally **not** Framework development. 

Standing on the shoulders of giants who answered my questions on StackOverflow and GitHub;  
it took me 5 years to
unlearn what I had learned in those many WWW years. And re-learn HTML back to
basics.

It is 2021, I am slowly getting comfortable with Web Components, but
know it is still early days.

Where frameworks deliver (semi-) finished products, Web Components are
atoms.. or maybe we should say quarks, because, like many developers, a
lot of scientists do not understand those either.

And yes, Web Components *__can__* built (semi-)finished products like
Design Systems.

I foresee a future where Web Components are used like we use Libraries
and CDNs today. NPM is Evil!
<br />But contrary to libraries, Web Components won't have a plethora of
functionalities.

* Good Web Components do one or two things very well

* Good Web Components, like Lego bricks, can be joined together to create more functionality

* Good Web Components can (IMHO) be extracted (and re-used) from the 'finished'
  product

* Good Web Components will be as free as the &lt;div> tag you wrote today

* And yes, [Lea](https://lea.verou.me/2020/09/the-failed-promise-of-web-components/), we need something to find those Good Web Components, <br />because
  there already is a lot of shit out there.

      
This is not a novel idea. This is how [Tim Berners-Lee](https://webfoundation.org/docs/2009/10/berners-lee.jpg) [envisioned the Web](https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/) to be when he wrote the paper in 1989
